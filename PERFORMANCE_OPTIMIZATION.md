# Performance Optimization for Vercel Deployment

## Files Added/Modified:

### 1. vercel.json
- Added proper rewrites for SPA routing
- Configured caching headers for static assets
- Added security headers
- Set up function runtime configuration

### 2. src/App.tsx
- Implemented lazy loading for all page components
- Added error boundary for better error handling
- Added 404 page handling
- Removed unused state variables
- Added Suspense wrapper with loading fallback

### 3. src/components/LoadingPage.tsx
- Created custom loading component with animation
- Brand-consistent loading experience
- Responsive design

### 4. vite.config.ts
- Enhanced build optimization
- Better chunk splitting
- Improved caching strategies
- Production optimizations

### 5. public/sw.js
- Service worker for caching
- Better offline experience
- Asset caching strategy

## Benefits:

1. **Smooth Page Reloading**: Vercel will now properly handle SPA routing
2. **Faster Loading**: Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
3. **Better Caching**: Optimized caching headers and service worker
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error boundaries and 404 handling
5. **Performance**: Code splitting and chunk optimization
6. **User Experience**: Loading states and smooth transitions

## Deployment Notes:

- The `vercel.json` ensures all routes are served properly
- Lazy loading will improve Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Static assets are cached for 1 year
- Error boundaries prevent white screen of death
- Service worker enables offline functionality

## Testing:

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test direct URL access (e.g., domain.com/about)
3. Test page refreshing on different routes
4. Check network tab for proper caching
5. Test error scenarios
